  - **Transform** (data processing) \- purple
  - **Destination** (warehouses, APIs) \- green

### **4\. Navigation & State**

- Route between landing page and chat
- Manage conversation and canvas state
- Persist theme preference

## **Technical Stack**

- **Icons:** Lucide React

## **Sample User Flow**

1. User enters: "Connect Shopify orders to Snowflake"
2. Navigate to chat interface
3. AI asks: "What's your Shopify store URL?", "Which data fields?", etc.
4. Canvas shows: \[Shopify\] â†’ \[Transform\] â†’ \[Snowflake\]
5. Nodes update status as user provides details
