# 🤖 GitHub Copilot Git Integration Setup

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Fixed the `/usr/bin/env: 'bash': No such file or directory` error that occurs when GitHub Copilot tries to commit code on Windows systems.

## 🔧 Multi-Platform Husky Hooks

### **Robust Hook Architecture:**
```
.husky/
├── pre-commit          # Main hook (shell script with fallbacks)
├── pre-commit.cjs      # Node.js CommonJS version
├── pre-commit.cmd      # Windows batch file version
├── pre-push            # Main hook (shell script with fallbacks)  
├── pre-push.cjs        # Node.js CommonJS version
└── pre-push.cmd        # Windows batch file version
```

### **How It Works:**
1. **Primary**: Shell script tries Node.js version first
2. **Fallback**: Direct npm script execution if Node.js fails
3. **Windows**: Batch files as additional backup

## 🚀 For GitHub Copilot Users

### **If You Still Get Bash Errors:**

#### **Option 1: Disable Husky Temporarily**
```bash
npm run husky:disable
# Make your commits
npm run husky:enable
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Quality Checks**
```bash
# Before committing, run these manually:
npm run lint              # Check code quality
npm run build            # Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run quality:report   # Generate full quality report
```

#### **Option 3: Use Git CLI Instead**
```bash
# Use terminal instead of Copilot's Git integration:
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin master
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **If Hooks Still Fail:**
1. **Check Node.js availability:**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Should show v16+ 
   npm --version   # Should show v8+
   ```

2. **Verify hook permissions:**
   ```bash
   # On Unix-like systems:
   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit .husky/pre-push
   ```

3. **Test hooks manually:**
   ```bash
   node .husky/pre-commit.cjs   # Test pre-commit
   node .husky/pre-push.cjs     # Test pre-push
   ```

### **Emergency Bypass:**
If you need to commit urgently and hooks are failing:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency commit"
```
⚠️ **Note**: This skips quality checks - use sparingly!

## 📊 Quality Checks Included

### **Pre-Commit:**
- ✅ ESLint (code quality)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Security audit
- ✅ Performance analysis  
- ✅ Accessibility validation
- ✅ Quality report generation
- ✅ Zero warnings policy

### **Pre-Push:**
- ✅ Production build verification
- ✅ Lightweight check to ensure code compiles

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When working correctly, you'll see:

**For commits:**
```
